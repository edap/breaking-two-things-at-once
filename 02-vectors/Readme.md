This app is an introduction to vectors as containers. You will use the Circle class and the penning equations from the previous sketches to build a composition of circles that moves around following your mouse.


### What did you learn?
How to add and edit elements in a container, how to create colors in RGB and HSB, how to define a palette of colors, how to animate the element in a container, how to modify them. What is an `map` and how you can use it to create a color palette.

### Exercise(s)

Create your own palette, invent your own animation. Read the two references regarding `std::maps` and `std::vectors`.
