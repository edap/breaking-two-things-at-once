# breaking-two-things-at-once

The goal of this course is to give to the students the instruments to explore computational thinking by themselves.
It is divided in lessons, and each lesson follow these rules:

- It introduces two topics at time.
- It pushes the students to make a decision that will influence the outcome of their sketches.
- It gives to the students references and learning paths to dig the topics further.
- It gives homeworks, and problems too.
- It contains subtle repetitions with the previous lessons
