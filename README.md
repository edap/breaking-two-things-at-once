# breaking-two-things-at-once

### Goals
The goal of this course is to give to the students the instruments to explore computational thinking.

### Structure
The course is divided in lessons, and each lesson follows these simple rules:

- It introduces two topics at time.
- It recalls the previous lessons.
- It suggests different ways to brake and fix the examples applications.
- It concludes with a final excercise

### Lessons

#### 1 Bouncing eyes.

- [Two eyes](https://github.com/edap/breaking-two-things-at-once/tree/master/01-two-eyes)
- [Easing](https://github.com/edap/breaking-two-things-at-once/tree/master/01-easing)

#### 2 C&C, AKA Containers and Colors.
- Topics: The c++ vector container and the RGB and HSB color spaces.
- Description: How to add and edit elements in a container, how to create colors in RGB and HSB, how to define a palette of colors, how to animate the element in a container. What is a GUI? how to add it to a sketch and why it is useful. What is an addon? how can I add it to an OF application?
