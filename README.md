# breaking-two-things-at-once

### Goals
The goal of this course is to give to the students the instruments to explore computational thinking.

### Structure
The course is divided in lessons, and each lesson follows these simple rules:

- It introduces two topics at time.
- It recalls the previous lessons.
- It suggests different ways to brake and fix the examples applications.
- It concludes with a final excercise

### Lessons

#### 1 Bouncing eyes.
- Topics: Principle of [Object Oriented Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) and [easing functions](http://easings.net/).
- Description: Intro to c++, intro to classes, objects, properties and methods. Intro to openFrameworks and the main loop. How to create an object, what is a constructor, how to move it using easing functions.

#### 2 C&C, AKA Containers and Colors.
- Topics: The c++ vector container and the RGB and HSB color spaces.
- Description: How to add and edit elements in a container, how to create colors in RGB and HSB, how to define a palette of colors, how to animate the element in a container. What is a GUI? how to add it to a sketch and why it is useful. What is an addon? how can I add it to an OF application?
- References, Josef Albers, "The Interaction of Colors"

#### 3 Move towards the bell.
- Topics: 2D vectors and sound
- Description: Position, acceleration and velocity. How to move objects towards a direction, how to make sounds, how to read the input of a microphone. 
- References: `examples/sound/audioInputExamples`

#### 3 Waves of lines.
- Topics: Lines and noise.
- Sine and Cosine, Perlin Noise, how to modulate waves, how to draw lines with `ofPolyline`, 

#### 4 Arduino writes letters to the monitor.
- Topics: Arduino and Fonts. 
- Description: How to read the input from arduino to change the text displayed in the OF application.
