# breaking-two-things-at-once

### Goals
The goal of this course is to give to the students the instruments to explore computational thinking.
It is divided in lessons, and each lesson follows these rules:

- It introduces two topics at time.
- It pushes the students to take decisions.
- It recalls the previous lessons.
