# breaking-two-things-at-once

### Goals
The goal of this course is to give to the students the instruments to explore computational thinking.

### Structure
The course is divided in lessons, and each lesson follows these simple rules:

- It introduces two topics at time.
- It recalls the previous lessons.
- It suggests different ways to brake and fix the examples applications.
- It concludes with a final excercise
